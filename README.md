# Cookie Clicker in Java
My approach on remaking Cookie Clicker in Java (with Beginner to Advanced Knowledge)

# Additional Info
- "grandma.png", "mine.png" and "factory.png" Icons are made by my friend https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClVxlCZYRA43e9rjVTBLl3g,    rest are my own, made with paint.net
- If you see something in the code, which is not really the way a Java Coder would do it, tell me so I can learn from my mistakes :)
- The cookie.wav is not my own but taken from here: https://freesound.org/people/GameAudio/sounds/220212/
